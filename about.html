    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Gladys Maniago; I am the daughter of Roman Maniago and Edna David. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. I was born on a cold, rainy day on December 13, 1987 in San Fernando, Pampanga. When I was young, I used to help my grandfather with farm work. There were days where all time is spent ensuring all the animals were fed and all the plants watered.Even in my young age I was thought the value of working hard.</p>

  <p>I entered formal education when I was 4 years old, unable to understand their language as they were speaking in Tagalog and I had only learned Pampango which was our local dialect my town. I remember being disheartened but pushed through remembering the teachings of my grandfather. Later on, I was speaking fluently in Tagalog and learned how to speak in English as well. Eventually, I loved going to school learning about science, math and my favorite reading.</p>
  <p>Almost half of my life was spent living in the Philippines. When I was 15, my family migrated to the United States of America. It was a change that would greatly influence our lives. It was then that I learned an important lesson. That you have to be able to adapt and learn that change can be a good thing. It has been 13 years now since we left my small town and as much as I miss there I have learned to love my life here.</p>
  <p>Living in America brought me new things and experiences. Such as huge libraries with all the books I could read. Technology that is widely available to everyone. In the near future I would like to master the world of programming. A place I've often lingered in but never really tried to venture.</p>
