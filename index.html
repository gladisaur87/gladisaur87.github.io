    <p>Hi there! I am Gladys Maniago. I live in Las Vegas and currently learning Front End Development at The Iron Yard in the ever blooming downtown area. I never thought that I would be going to school to become a developer and here I am now enjoying every minute of it. There is something very satisfying about staring at a blank page and making something off of it.</p>
    <p>This website will be showcasing all the things I have learned thus far, what my interests are and some tidbits about me. With the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I hope to bring life to a website using all the techniques, skills and best practices I have discovered. My goals are to master these three programs by the end of the course and to keep learning. Stopping there would just be boring!</p>
    <p>Please join me in my journey as I learn to develop learn, breathe and dream code one pixel at a time.
