    <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p> Week 1</p>
        <p>During the first week, we installed the programs that we will be needing through-out the course such as Github, Google Chrome and Node and Sublime Text. We learned the basics of HTML, CSS and we were introduced to the Command Line and dabbled with Github. The main take aways I took from the first week is the importance of Semantics and proper nesting.</p>
      <p>Week 2</p>
        <p>The second served as a more indepht lesson on using terminal to navigate around our computer and its uses for Github. We also learned more about CSS. In particular, were learned about positioning and floats. During class, we emulated Chase's websites style. It showed me the complexity that goes to the layout of a website.</p>
        <p>Key take aways would be learning the Box Model. (I still have to read up on this!) Another is being more comfortable with using the terminal, using basic git commands  and using basic CSS to design a webpage.</p>
