    <h5 style= "word-spacing: .1px">Final Fantasy VII Remake Announced!</h5>

    <p>So I know I am a bit late in realizing this news, but I cannot fully express just how excited I am. The official announcement was made on June 15. The original game was the first ever game I played in the series. I just remember a younger me buying my first second hand PlayStation when I was 14. Needless to say I am taken back to those summer days where I shamelessly spent majority of my time playing the game. I was obsesssed.</p>
    <p>I am sharing the same feeling as us countless fans await its release. I am denifinetly stoked. As excited I was when the first Lord of the Rings film rolled out. FF7 is probably one of my favorite RPG games and it's probably fortunate that the remake will not be coming into store shelves until 2016 because if it did come out this year. I am not sure if I'll have enough discipline to study for my Front End class and work at the same time. It should be expected that when the time comes, my old habits of holing in my room  day in day out will come back.</p>
    <p>Check out the trailer and join me in the geek out!</p>

    <p>This is my first ever blog. Here you will find what interests me. One thing I am very much passionate about it lessening the carbon footprint we leave here on earth. I hope to share y thoughts on this subject among other things. Like making the font on the listed and tabled items here on this page smaller than their size right now. I also need to get the borders to work on the table.
